# Raw data

**Dataset:** Bank Customer Churn (Kaggle-style schema). Local file: **Churn_Modelling.csv**.

- The project uses `data/raw/Churn_Modelling.csv` (10,000 rows). You can replace it with your own export (e.g. from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers)) as long as column names match: RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, Exited.
- Notebooks and `scripts/run_analysis.py` expect: `../data/raw/Churn_Modelling.csv` (from project root: `data/raw/Churn_Modelling.csv`).
